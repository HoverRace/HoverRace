**This is the _unstable_ branch of HoverRace.**
The current stable branch is: [1.24](https://github.com/HoverRace/HoverRace/tree/1.24)

HoverRace is an online racing game originally written by Grokksoft in the mid-1990s. After Grokksoft stopped maintaining the game in the late 1990s, HoverRace was abandonware for a number of years before the original developer, Richard Langlois, opened up the source code to the public. Since then, development has been ongoing to bring HoverRace into the 21st century.

Features
--------

 * Fast, free, and fun!
 * Single-player and multiplayer (split-screen and internet).
 * Hundreds of user-created tracks available for download.

Portability
-----------

HoverRace currently runs on Windows, but the code is slowing being rewritten to be portable.  A single-player proof-of-concept runs on Linux.
