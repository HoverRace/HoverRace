HoverCad
========

This is the classic (HoverRace 1.x) track editor.

Although the track format hasn't changed between HoverRace 1.x and 2.x, this editor is no longer supported because:

* It's Windows-only.
* It's strongly tied to the old MFC framework.
* It hasn't been updated for compatibility since Visual Studio 2003.

For now, this codebase is kept for historical reference.
