Add a Tutorial for SQLite newbies
Add a real example (rework current example?)

Improve Github Wiki pages with the FAQ: Installation, Examples, Tutorial, How to contribute
Publish the Doxygen Documentation in the Github Pages (gh-pages branch)

Missing features in v1.1.0:
- bind a SQLITE_STATIC value (string/blob)
- bind a dynamic value with zerocopy (unlike SQLITE_TRANSIENT) with custom deleter
- #24: executemany() like in Python https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.executemany
- #34: Better type for getColumn

Missing documentation in v1.1.0:
- explain the noncopyable property for RAII design
- comment on returning error code instead of exception that shall not be thrown when expected (!?)

Missing unit tests in v1.0.0:
- Binding variants
- Create Function
- Assert Handler
- Load Extension (not practicable, and easy to verify by code review)

Advanced missing features:
- #39: SAVEPOINT https://www.sqlite.org/lang_savepoint.html

- backup support to/from file/:memory:
- Add optional usage of experimental sqlite3_trace() function to enable statistics 
- Agregate ?

- support for different transaction mode ? NO: too specific
- operator<< binding ? NO: redundant with bind()
- ATTACH Database ? NO: can already be done by "ATTACH" Statement

Post an article to CodeProject: Is there a license issue ?
